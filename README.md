# Surfs Up Challenge
Use of SQLAlchemy, SQLite and Flask

## Overview of Project
In an effort to prepare for a potential surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, temperature analysis was performed. After the initial analysis was performed, additional analysis was performed on June vs December temperature data. 

## Results and Code
- The average temperature in June was 74 degrees versus 71 degrees in December; both those values fall within the standard deviation of each other so there is no statistical significance bewteen these values
- The temperature high in June is 85 while the temperature high in December is 83; regardless of season, the temperature doesn't change much
- The most dramatic difference in temperature is the low; the temperature low in June is 64 vs 56 in December. 

## Summary
Despite the different seasons, the average and high temperature between June and December over a 6 year period isn't very close. The difference between June and December lie in the lowest temperature; that would have to be soemthing to take into consideration when it comes to evening crowds and activities. The shop may need to close early in December. Additional analysis that can be performed can look at the precipitation in those specific months, see if there is a difference in that regard. Also, to compare how many high days there are in June vs December.
